<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
Ideosphere Inc. (“Ideosphere”) operates the website schoolarly.com. It is Ideosphere’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
Like most website operators, Ideosphere collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, 

referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ideosphere’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ideosphere’s visitors use its website. From time 

to time, Ideosphere may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>

<p>
Ideosphere also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Ideosphere does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such 

information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
Certain visitors to Ideosphere’s websites choose to interact with Ideosphere in ways that require Ideosphere to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ideosphere 

gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at schoolarly.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 

Ideosphere – by subscribing to the schoolarly.com service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those 

transactions. In each case, Ideosphere collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ideosphere. Ideosphere does not disclose 

personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain 

website-related activities.
</p>

<p>

<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
Ideosphere may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Ideosphere may monitor the most used accounts on the schoolarly.com site. Ideosphere may display this information 

publicly or provide it to others. However, Ideosphere does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>

<p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
Ideosphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order 

to process it on Ideosphere’s behalf or to provide services available at Ideosphere’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated 

organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ideosphere’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ideosphere will not rent or sell potentially personally-

identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ideosphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and 

personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Ideosphere believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ideosphere, third 

parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the schoolarly.com website and have supplied your email address, Ideosphere may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, 

solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ideosphere and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a 

support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ideosphere takes all measures 

reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

<h4>Ads</h4>
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
