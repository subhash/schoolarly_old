</p>
<p>
</p><h4>Responsibility of Contributors. </h4>If you operate an account, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, �Content�), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that: the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party; if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content; you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms; the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content; the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
the Content is not pornographic, libelous or defamatory (more info on what that means), does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party; your account is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person, institution or company.

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
Ideosphere Inc. (�Ideosphere�) operates the website schoolarly.com. It is Ideosphere�s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
</p>

<p>
</p><h4>Website Visitors</h4>
Like most website operators, Ideosphere collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, 

referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ideosphere�s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ideosphere�s visitors use its website. From time 

to time, Ideosphere may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.


<p>
Ideosphere also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Ideosphere does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such 

information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>

<p>
</p><h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
Certain visitors to Ideosphere�s websites choose to interact with Ideosphere in ways that require Ideosphere to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ideosphere 

gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at schoolarly.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 

Ideosphere � by subscribing to the schoolarly.com service, for example � are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those 

transactions. In each case, Ideosphere collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor�s interaction with Ideosphere. Ideosphere does not disclose 

personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain 

website-related activities.


<p>

</p><h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
Ideosphere may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Ideosphere may monitor the most used accounts on the schoolarly.com site. Ideosphere may display this information 

publicly or provide it to others. However, Ideosphere does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.


<p>

</p><h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
Ideosphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order 

to process it on Ideosphere�s behalf or to provide services available at Ideosphere�s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated 

organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ideosphere�s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ideosphere will not rent or sell potentially personally-

identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ideosphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and 

personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Ideosphere believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ideosphere, third 

parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the schoolarly.com website and have supplied your email address, Ideosphere may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, 

solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what�s going on with Ideosphere and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a 

support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ideosphere takes all measures 

reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.


<p>

</p><h4>Cookies</h4>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor�s computer, and that the visitor�s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ideosphere uses cookies to help Ideosphere 

identify and track visitors, their usage of Ideosphere website, and their website access preferences. Ideosphere visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to 

refuse cookies before using Ideosphere�s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Ideosphere�s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.


<p>

</p><h4>Ads</h4>
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 

advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most 

interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Ideosphere and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.


<p>

</p><h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Ideosphere may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Ideosphere�s sole discretion. Ideosphere encourages visitors to frequently check this page for 

any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
